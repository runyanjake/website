[Jake's West Coast](https://www.youtube.com/@jakeswestcoast) is my cycling brand and YouTube channel. I've been cycling in some capacity since I was a child, but have explored it as a serious hobby since going to school in Santa Cruz, CA.

I got my start riding in the UC Upper Campus, riding the singletrack above school before classes. I rode a retrofitted Specialized Rockhopper during this time.

After graduation, I did a lot of mountain biking as well in the Santa Cruz mountains. Home was under an hour away from school, so my friends and I often found ourselves back in the mountains riding UCSC's "9 Drops" as well as in the Soquel Demonstration State Forest. I aptly rode a Santa Cruz Tallboy while we were in our MTB phase.

During Covid in 2020, I started to do gravel rides as the interests of my riding group changed.
