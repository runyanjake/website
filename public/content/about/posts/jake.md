I'm a Bay Area native currently living and working in the South Bay.

I'm a lover of technology, my many side projects, and the outdoors. I currently work as a software engineer at [Egnyte](https://www.egnyte.com) on platform infrastructure, developing distributed microservices in the cloud. Interests of mine include automation, distributed cloud computing, homelabbing, and trying out whatever the hot new thing is. 

In my personal life, I love cooking new things, improving at volleyball, basketball, soccer and cycling, & whatever else I am currently fixated on.
