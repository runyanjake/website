Content focused website template. Bring your own config and generate your website.

## Setup

### First Time Setup
We're building with Vite + React.
```
npm install react@^19.0.0 react-dom@^19.0.0
npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react
```
and move files to the repo root so the project structure is readable in github.

Run:
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
